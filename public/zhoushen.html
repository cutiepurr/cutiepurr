                    <h2 style='color: #224394'>About Zhou Shen 周深</h2>
                    <p>Okay, dear. You can visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Shen">Wikipedia</a> cuz I'm
                        lazy:)))</p>
                    <p>.<br>.<br>.</p>
                    <p>Just kidding. I'll tell some main points.</p>
                    <p>Zhou Shen is a Chinese singer known for super high male
                        voice. His voice is often descirbed as somewhat between a female's voice and a little boy's.
                        Because of this, he has lots of struggles to make the public accept his unique voice, especially
                        when he just debuted:((.
                    <p>Or more straightforward, some people find his voice 'disgusting' when they realize it's a male
                        singing.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>His best known song is <i>Big Fish</i> (<a href="https://youtu.be/-aMdBA00Ijc">YouTube</a>).
                        A beautiful and soft song.</p>
                    <p>He joined lots of TV shows and sang lots of OSTs. Most of my favorite Zhou Shen's songs are from
                        TV shows.</p>

                    <p>Through this one (more p.recisely, the first 30 secs:))):</p>
                    <div class="facebook-responsive">
                        <iframe
                            src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=314&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FZhouShenVNFC%2Fvideos%2F644268759760809%2F&show_text=false&width=560&t=0"

                    <label><i>From The Masked Singer S3 2018 - Vietnamese subtitle only (sorry)</i></label>
                    <p>So I passed by this video while scrolling Facebook videos (it's addictive, you know). It was a
                        ten-minute video, and since I used to be not that interested in Chinese songs, I only listened
                        to the first 30 seconds.</p>
                    <p>My brain, however, kept playing the song for some hours after I scrolled by. It was just stuck in
                        my head! Luckily, I've already hit the like button, so it was not that hard to find it.</p>
                    <p>This video is a part of a music show where singers wore a mask and the judges have to guess who
                        the singer is. So, felt quite surprised after I re-found the video and knew it was a male singer
                        called Zhou Shen who sang it. That's when I started being a fan of him!</p>
                </div>

                <div style='margin-top: 50px;' id='love'>
                    <h2 style='color: #224394'>What do I love about him?</h2>
                    <img src="zhoushen-c929.gif" class='img'>
                    <h3>His voice</h3>
                    <p>Definitely his voice is the top reason why I love Zhou Shen. It's ethereal, pure like an angel. I
                        feel like I'm in heaven whenever
                        I hear his songs. His voice always helps me stay calm and peaceful.
                    </p>
                    <p>What's the most impressive thing is Zhou Shen can do a lot of singing styles and genres. He
                        mainly sings pop music, sometimes also
                        combines opera, folk, Chinese opera (xiqu) elements (Fun fact: Zhou Shen studied Bel Canto
                        (often used in opera) in college). He often
                        sings romantic songs with Chinese traditional element, but also sings 'stronger' songs with rock
                        and roll element, or maybe basically
                        more modern pop songs.
                    </p>
                    <p>Zhou Shen is capable of imitating different voices such as crying toddler, loli, Siri,
                        switchboard, dog, screaming pig, etc:))
                    </p>
                    <h3>His hilarity</h3>
                    <p>Hmmm, I don't know where to start. He's joking with fans in his concerts. He's joking when he's
                        interviewed. He's joking when doing a TV show.
                        He's joking by altering the lyrics. His joke also becomes memes among Chinese netizens. The most
                        popular one might be 'Just leave me alone'.
                    </p>
                    <img src="https://www.faxing.com/Upload/Articles/661/0/125/125317_20210625154500859.png" alt=""
                        width='200'>
                    <p>Watching TV shows that he did is currently one of my entertainment activities!</p>
                    <h3>His sincerity</h3>
                    <p>He's funny, and at the same time, he's sincere. I often hear people say that Zhou Shen is like 'a
                        pure flow of water' in the Chinese showbiz (haha celebrities have lots of dramas).
                        And I think it's true, because at least from what I see how he interacts with people, with
                        other singers, with his fans, with the production teams,
                        he's a sincere and respectful person.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of his iconic traits is after singing, he'll say 'Thank you'. It may sound pretty normal, but if you watch a large number of him singing on TV shows and stuff,
                        it'll be strange enough. Sometimes I want to burst into laugh when he does that after singing a super sad song, because it just doesn't fit the 
                        mood!
                    </p>
                    <p>I know that because he's currently my idol, he looks good in every aspect, so I hope that he can still be that 'pure flow of water'.
                    </p>
